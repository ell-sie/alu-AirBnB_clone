**THE AirBnB Clone**

**01 - Creating the Console Support for Line-Oriented Command Interpreter AirBnB Clone**

---
**THE CONSOLE FOR THE AirBnB CLONE**

The AirBnB Clone project allows you to manage and replicate your own bookings and listings on AirBnB.
The purpose of this project is to provide practice with Python and 
demonstrate how to use an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system to handle data.

---
**GETTING STARTED**

To get started with the AirBnB Clone project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AirBnB_clone.git
Navigate to the project's root directory:
bash
Copy code
cd AirBnB_clone
Launch the console by entering the following command on your terminal:
javascript
Copy code
./console.py
Writing a Command Interpreter
Writing a command interpreter is a crucial first step in managing your AirBnB objects. This will allow you to use the things you create for this project in all subsequent projects, such as the database store, API, front-end in HTML/CSS, etc.

**THE CONSOLE**

Using the Console\
The AirBnB data model may be accessed using the console. The following fundamental commands are available:

|Command  | Description                                                                                | Example|
| --- |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| --- | 
|create <class name> | Creates a new instance of the specified class and saves it to the JSON file                | create User |
|show <class name> <object id>| Displays the string representation of the specified object                                 | show User 89302|
|all <class name> | Displays all instances of the specified class, or all objects if no class name is provided | all User|
|destroy <class name> <object id>| deletes the specified object                                                               | destroy User 79303|
|update <class name> <object id> <attribute name> "<attribute value>" |  updates the specified object with the new attribute value                                 |update User 1 name "John Doe"|

        self.id = id
        self.created_at = created_at
